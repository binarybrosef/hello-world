# hello-world
An introduction to GitHub.

## Description
This is my first foray into GitHub as guided by GitHub's handy introduction tutorial, which can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world). **Thanks Github!**

## About me
I'm an aspiring machine learning engineer, data scientist, and programmer. And I couldn't be *happier* to be on GitHub. [^1]
